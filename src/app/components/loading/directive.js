    **  This is because ng-transclude automatically assigns the transcluded
    **  content a new *child* scope of the transcluded contents's context.
    **  However, we want the transcluded html to keep the *same* scope of its
    **  context so that its behaviour is unaffected, and changes made within it
    **  are reflected in it's context's scope.
    **
    **  To do this, we make the scope of the transcluded content that of
    **  the parent scope of this directive. (even though the scope
    **  is isolate, its $parent is actually still that of its context,
    **  there just isn't any prototypical inheritance).
    **  The directive's context ($parent) and the context of the transcluded
    **  content are the same, so the transcluded content keeps the scope
    **  of its parent, as desired.
    **
    **  This is implemented through use of the transclude function.
    **  The second param clones the transcluded html and assigns it the scope
    **  supplied in the first parameter. You can then do with it as you want,
    **  and so we append it to the directive template (having removed ng-transclude
    **  from the end of the template also).
